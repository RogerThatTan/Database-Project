## Introduction

The report begins with an introduction to the concept of e-commerce and its database requirements. E-commerce involves the buying and selling of products online, necessitating robust data management to handle daily operations like user management, product listings, inventory control, shopping carts, and payment processing. The project addresses these needs through a comprehensive database system.

## ER-Diagram

The Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram provides a visual representation of the database structure, illustrating the relationships between various entities such as companies, officers, employees, sellers, products, warehouses, customers, and orders.

## Normalization

The report details the normalization process, which organizes the database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Each entity relationship is broken down into multiple normal forms (UNF, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to ensure efficient data management.

## Final Table

The final table schema is presented, summarizing the fully normalized tables along with their attributes and relationships.

## Table Creation

This section covers the SQL scripts used to create the database tables. Each table creation script includes the necessary fields, data types, and constraints to enforce data integrity.

## Sequence

The sequence diagrams and scripts illustrate the order of operations for inserting, updating, and deleting data within the database, ensuring that all dependencies and relationships are maintained correctly.

## Data Insertion

Examples of data insertion scripts are provided, demonstrating how to populate the tables with initial data for testing and operational purposes.

## Constraints

The report includes details on the constraints applied to the database tables, such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and checks, to maintain data accuracy and consistency.

## View

The view section explains how to create and utilize database views to simplify complex queries and present data in a more accessible format.
